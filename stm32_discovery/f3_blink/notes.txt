(TODO: organize these into something more central)

got startup_stm32f30x.s, system_stm32f30x.c from the STM32F3Discovery examples package
same for ../common/stm32_bare/stm32.ld

current status:
- flash programming works (copying test.bin from stm32-test works)
- compiling works (copying blink.o to tut.o works)
- linking doesn't crash

feels like there's either an issue in linking or in the startup code

should probably move the system_* and startup_* files into the common dir and have them managed by that makefile


debugging:
- not sure what those existing commands are, but:
- /home/kmod/arm-cross/bin/openocd -f ../common/stm32/STM32F3-openocd.cfg
-- serves a telnet on :4444
-- serves a gdb remote server on :3333
- gdb --args blink.elf
-- target remote localhost:3333
- on the telnet, do "reset halt" to start it at the beginning
-- looks like you can do this through gdb using the "mon" command, ie "mon reset halt"
