(TODO: organize these into something more central)

got startup_stm32f30x.s, system_stm32f30x.c from the STM32F3Discovery examples package
same for ../common/stm32_bare/stm32.ld

current status:
- flash programming works (copying test.bin from stm32-test works)
- compiling works (copying blink.o to tut.o works)
- linking doesn't crash

feels like there's either an issue in linking or in the startup code

should probably move the system_* and startup_* files into the common dir and have them managed by that makefile
